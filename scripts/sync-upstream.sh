# sync-upstream.sh — pull the upstream stable line into Pocket Daily's main.
#
# Pocket Daily is an independent product built on the upstream CrossPoint
# reader engine. AgentDeck is one optional Companion provider. We follow
# upstream's STABLE line (upstream/master, where releases land), not develop.
#
# Why merge (not rebase): Pocket Daily has product commits layered on top. A
# rebase would replay all of them and force re-resolving the same conflicts
# every sync. A merge resolves once and preserves the AgentDeck history.
#
# This script only fetches + merges on a local branch. It does NOT push — review
# the merge and build first, then `git push origin main` yourself.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/sync-upstream.sh            # sync main with upstream/master
#   ./scripts/sync-upstream.sh --check    # only report pending upstream commits
